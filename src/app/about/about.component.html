    I'm Lucas Burns, a Full Stack Software Engineer in Portland, Oregon. 
    I graduated from the University of Portland in May 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
    From November 2017 until February 2020, I worked at EVRAZ North America as a Full Stack Software Developer. 
    There I built Java, C, and Javascript apps used throughout EVRAZ facilities.
    Since then, I've worked full time at Driveway.com (part of Lithia Motors) to create backend services for <a href="https://driveway.com/shop">Driveway.com's pre-owned vehicle offerings</a> in Kotlin and Spring.
    The majority of my work at Driveway.com has been in the context of inventory search, and it has been a great opportunity to try some of the more complex features of MongoDB.
    I've also greatly enjoyed learning to write GraphQL services as part of optimizing our search functionality since the potential performance benefits are quite noticeable.

    Coding is not just a job to me however, and in my spare time I've been working on a <a href="https://github.com/BurnsCommaLucas/ready-bot" target="_blank">Discord bot</a>.
    The bot runs ready-checks for players of tabletop RPGs and other online games which require group coordination, and is currently used on 500+ servers.
    Similarly, this website was previously plain HTML/CSS and one of my previous projects was to update it to use Angular, the result of that being the site you are currently viewing.
    In the process, I cleaned up the look and added a color picker to the navbar to give a bit of flair to the site as a whole.
    I no longer host the old version anywhere, but you can check out the source code <a href="https://github.com/BurnsCommaLucas/burnscommalucas.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>.
    Game development is also an interest I have been working at for a few years now, and I'm constantly working on a few demo games which I'll link here when they're ready.

    My other main hobby is playing music solo or with friends!
    I've played music fairly regularly for the last 21 years; I started with piano, then moved on to cello briefly, tried my hand at the trumpet, then stuck to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphonium">euphonium</a> for roughly 10 years.
    Along the way I picked up guitar, bass, drums, and singing and now I occasionally record covers of songs as the mood strikes me.
    One cover I had particular fun with was Irving Berlin's "White Christmas" which I got partway through before my computer died and lost the project file. 
    You can listen to what remains of the song <a href="../../assets/White Christmas - Lucas Burns.m4a" target="_blank">here (check your volume before clicking!)</a>.
    At the moment, my work-in-progress tunes are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtFmhaILEkY" target="_blank">Gymnopédie no. 1</a> by Erik Satie, and – as a fun respite from classical guitar – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-zNQA5Xi4Q" target="_blank">Ring of Fire</a> by Johnny Cash.
