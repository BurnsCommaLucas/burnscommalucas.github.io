    I'm Lucas Burns, a Full Stack Software Engineer in Portland, Oregon. 
    I graduated from the University of Portland in May 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
    I have worked at EVRAZ North America since November 2017 building apps used by internal and external customers.
    My professional skills include frontend and backend development, database design, and Linux server administration.

    Coding is not just a job to me however, and in my spare time I've been working on a public <a href="https://github.com/BurnsCommaLucas/ready-bot" target="_blank">Discord bot</a>.
    The bot runs ready-checks for players of tabletop RPGs and other online games which require group coordination. 
    I've also been working to port this very website from plain HTML/CSS into Angular.

    I also greatly enjoy playing music by myself or with friends; I finally got back to taking guitar lessons after 8 years away!   
    Lately I've been enjoying the reuploading of old cartoons to YouTube from 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/homestarrunnerdotcom" target="_blank">Homestar Runner,</a>
    my favorite soon-to-be defunct flash website.
