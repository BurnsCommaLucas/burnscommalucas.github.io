  <p>I'm Lucas Burns, a Software Engineer in Portland, Oregon. I graduated from the University of Portland in May of 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science. As of November 2017, I work as a Software Engineer at EVRAZ North America.</p>
  <p>Recently I've been working on a public <a href="https://github.com/BurnsCommaLucas/ready-bot" target="_blank">Discord bot</a> which runs ready-checks for playing tabletop RPGs and other coordinated games online. I've also been working to port this very website from plain HTML/CSS into Angular. You can check out the old version here</p>
  <p>I am passionate about making efficient and effective code. I also enjoy building PCs, shooting and editing video, as well as playing and creating both computer and card games. Lately I cannot get enough of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCckETVOT59aYw80B36aP9vw" target="_blank">Matthias Wandel's</a> woodworking<span class="blink">.</span></p>
